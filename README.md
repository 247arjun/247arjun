# 👋 Hi, I'm Arjun

I'm a Security Engineering Manager at Microsoft, working to keep Microsoft Cloud customers protected and productive. I'm deeply passionate about security, and love to learn and share things related to security.

- 🌩️ I currently work in the Azure Security organization at Microsoft, leading a team of Security Engineers protecting the Microsoft Cloud.

- 👨‍💻 I have developed and published open-source MCP Servers for [`curl`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@247arjun/mcp-curl), [`grep`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@247arjun/mcp-grep) and [`jq`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@247arjun/mcp-jq), allowing conversational invocation of these utilities.

- 🎙️ I have been a guest on **Microsoft's BlueHat Podcast**, sharing [my journey from Software Engineer to Security Engineer](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-bluehat-podcast/id1688087915?i=1000674973320).

- 👨‍🏫 I co-delivered a workshop on [SAST using Semgrep](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-workshops.html#54210), at **DEF CON 32**.

- 🎤 I presented multiple talks, including at **DEF CON 29** ("[AppSec 101: A Journey from Engineer to Hacker](https://youtu.be/7jiUt_TqfG4)"), at the **National Cybersecurity Alliance** [Convene in Seattle](https://staysafeonline.org/programs/events/convene-seattle-2024/) educating cybersecurity awareness professionals about AppSec, and numerous talks internal to my employer.

- 🤖 I have written papers on [using GenAI to help prioritize triage of SAST results](https://github.com/247arjun/ai-secure-code-review/blob/main/Automated%20Secure%20Code%20Review%20at%20Scale%20Using%20Static%20Analysis%20and%20Generative%20AI.md) as well as [Elevating Code Security and Reliability via LLM-Augmented Static Analysis](https://github.com/247arjun/ai-static-analysis-pipeline/blob/main/Elevating%20Code%20Security%20and%20Reliability%20via%20LLM-Augmented%20Static%20Analysis.md)

- ✍️ I have authored an article in the **ISACA Journal** on [A New Way to Upskill the Workforce](https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2023/volume-6/learning-while-earning-a-new-way-to-upskill-the-workforce)

- 📚 A short story I wrote won the 2nd place in the 2020 DEF CON Short Story contest.
  - You can find the story on [Apple Books](https://books.apple.com/us/book/plug-and-play/id1521590505) and on [GitHub](https://gist.github.com/504f8100bcd01bf2b998c674a390f6f0).

- 📱 I published an app - [AntiSocial](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anti-social/id1516200820) - to the App Store that allows you to block tracking from popular social networks. The app is also [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/247arjun/AntiSocialApp).
