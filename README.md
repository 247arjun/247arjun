# Hi, I'm Arjun 👋

I'm a Security Engineering Manager at Microsoft, working on keeping Microsoft Cloud customers protected and productive. I'm deeply passionate about security, and love to read and share - learn and teach - things related to security.

- 🖥️ I currently work in the Azure Security organization at Microsoft, leading a team of Security Engineers protecting the Microsoft Cloud.
- 🎙️ I have been a guest on Microsoft's [BlueHat Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-bluehat-podcast/id1688087915?i=1000674973320), sharing my journey from Software Engineer to Security Engineer.
- 👨‍🏫 I co-delivered a workshop on [SAST using Semgrep](https://defcon.org/html/defcon-32/dc-32-workshops.html#54210), at DEF CON 32.
- 🎤 I have presented at the [National Cybersecurity Alliance Convene in Seattle](https://staysafeonline.org/programs/events/convene-seattle-2024/), educating cybersecurity awareness professionals about AppSec.
- 🤖 I have written a paper on [using GenAI to help prioritize triage of SAST results](https://github.com/247arjun/ai-secure-code-review/blob/main/Automated%20Secure%20Code%20Review%20at%20Scale%20Using%20Static%20Analysis%20and%20Generative%20AI.md)
- ✍️ I have authored an article in the ISACA Journal on [A New Way to Upskill the Workforce](https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2023/volume-6/learning-while-earning-a-new-way-to-upskill-the-workforce)
- 🎤 I presented a talk "[AppSec 101: A Journey from Engineer to Hacker](https://youtu.be/7jiUt_TqfG4)" at DEF CON 29.
- 📚 A short story I wrote won the 2nd place in the 2020 DEFCON Short Story contest.
  - You can find the story on [Apple Books](https://books.apple.com/us/book/plug-and-play/id1521590505) and on [GitHub](https://gist.github.com/504f8100bcd01bf2b998c674a390f6f0).
- 📱 I published an app - [AntiSocial](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anti-social/id1516200820) - to the App Store that allows you to block tracking from popular social networks. The app is also [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/247arjun/AntiSocialApp).
